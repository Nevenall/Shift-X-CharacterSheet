# Shift-X Character Sheet Design Notes

## Assets
Maybe we can use the bigtime bullet as an svg and then we could switch to the league font, which might be more managable. 

## Layout

Grid is great, we can deal with grids. Need some column space though, it's real crowded
and some borders would be awesome. 
I don't need to make it look like the blades sheet, but it would like it to look nice. 


## Html templating

It would be nice to be able to simplify the creation of the html. I guess Pug is ok, but I wish there were a perfect html templating engine. 


todo - svg assets so we can better control their style, can do cool stuff

todo - need a class for radio groups so we can do the flexbox display

todo - once there is radiogroup class we can add some universal margins around all but them.

todo - add informational footer with dice roller and xp triggers

todo - change character name to a label populated so we can better lay it out with the concept.
