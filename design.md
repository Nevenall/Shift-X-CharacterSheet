# Shift-X Character Sheet Design Notes

## Assets
Maybe we can use the bigtime bullet as an svg and then we could switch to the league font, which might be more managable. 

## Layout

Grid is great, we can deal with grids. Need some column space though, it's real crowded
and some borders would be awesome. 
I don't need to make it look like the blades sheet, but it would like it to look nice. 


## Html templating

It would be nice to be able to simplify the creation of the html. I guess Pug is ok, but I wish there were a perfect html templating engine. 


todo - svg assets so we can better control their style, can do cool stuff

todo - add informational footer xp triggers

todo - add a villain and NPC version of the character sheet. Maybe as a tab like the bitd sheet does.

todo - can we use sheet worker to dynamically add powersets?

todo - height of abilities textbox description
